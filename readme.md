# About Judith

Judith is a WIP statically-typed programming language that compiles to JASM (Judith Assembly). JASM is interpreted by the JuVM (Judith Virtual Machine).

Judith is a personal project started in February 2024, and is a work in progress.

A (very) informal specification of the language can be found in [.info/spec.jud](.info/spec.jud).
